    look:"Rank them by how smoky you expect from the numbers, then taste blind and rank by how smoky they actually seem.",
    lesson:"Ardbeg carries the highest phenol count and usually reads cleanest, because its purifier pipe strips the heaviest compounds. Laphroaig's peat is medicinal and iodine-driven; Highland Park's is floral and honeyed because Orkney's peat is heather rather than woodland. Peat level is a measurement of the malt, not a prediction of the glass." },
  { name:"Yeast Is an Ingredient", cat:"Whiskey", teaches:"That the same grain and the same warehouse can produce different whiskeys.",
    pours:["Four Roses Single Barrel (OBSV recipe)","Four Roses Small Batch (blend of four recipes)","Any second Four Roses single-barrel recipe you can find"],
    look:"Same distillery, same warehouses, same climate. Note fruit versus spice versus floral.",
    lesson:"Four Roses runs two mashbills against five proprietary yeast strains for ten distinct recipes. Most drinkers assume mashbill drives flavor; this flight shows yeast doing at least as much work." },
  { name:"Grain to Glass: The Bourbon Variables", cat:"Whiskey", teaches:"How mashbill and proof change texture, not just flavor.",
    pours:["Maker's Mark — wheated","Wild Turkey 101 — high rye, low barrel entry proof","Buffalo Trace — low rye, standard entry proof"],
    look:"Rank by sweetness, then by spice, then by mouthfeel weight. Note where heat appears on the palate.",
    lesson:"Wheat softens and rounds; rye sharpens and adds pepper and dill. Wild Turkey's lower barrel entry proof means less water added at bottling, which is why it feels denser than its price suggests." },
  { name:"Juniper Forward, Juniper Back", cat:"Gin", teaches:"The full range the word 'gin' covers.",
    pours:["Tanqueray — four botanicals, juniper-dominant","Plymouth — softer, root-forward","Monkey 47 or Hendrick's — contemporary style"],
    look:"Find juniper in each. Note how hard you have to hunt for it in the third.",
    lesson:"London Dry is a production method, not a flavor promise. Contemporary gins are legal as long as juniper dominates — but 'dominates' leaves enormous room. Knowing where a bottle sits on this spectrum tells you whether it will survive a Negroni." },
  { name:"Old Tom and the Missing Sweetness", cat:"Gin", teaches:"Why 19th-century recipes taste wrong with modern gin.",
    pours:["Hayman's London Dry","Hayman's Old Tom","Genever, if you can find it"],
    look:"Taste each neat, then make a small Martinez with each.",
    lesson:"Old Tom's light sweetening is the bridge between malty genever and bone-dry London Dry. The Martinez, the original Tom Collins, and much of the pre-1900 canon were written for it — which is why they taste thin and harsh when built with modern dry gin." },
  { name:"Molasses, Cane, and Funk", cat:"Rum", teaches:"That 'rum' describes at least three unrelated spirits.",
    pours:["A clean Spanish-style white (Havana Club 3 or Probitas)","A Jamaican pot still (Appleton Signature or Hampden)","A rhum agricole blanc (Rhum J.M or Neisson)"],
    look:"Nose all three before tasting. The agricole should smell like a cut lawn; the Jamaican like overripe fruit and glue.",
    lesson:"Base material and still type matter more than color or age. Once you can identify these three poles blind, you can reverse-engineer almost any rum cocktail — and you'll understand why swapping rums changes a Daiquiri completely." },
  { name:"Terroir in Agave", cat:"Agave", teaches:"That where the plant grew is legible in the glass.",
    pours:["A Los Altos highland blanco (Tequila Ocho or G4)","A valley blanco (Cascahuín or Fortaleza)","An espadín mezcal (Del Maguey Vida)"],
    look:"Rank by fruitiness, then by earthiness and pepper. Note where minerality appears.",
    lesson:"Highland agave grows in iron-rich red soil at altitude and tends fruity and floral; valley agave tends earthy, peppery, and mineral. The mezcal adds pit-roasting on top of both variables, which is why smoke is a production choice rather than an agave characteristic." },
  { name:"Additives and the Honest Blanco", cat:"Agave", teaches:"To recognize what shouldn't be there.",
    pours:["A verified additive-free blanco (Fortaleza, Ocho, G4, Siete Leguas)","A widely available mass-market blanco","A third of either kind, poured blind by a friend"],
    look:"Look specifically for vanilla, caramel, or a syrupy roundness in an unaged spirit. It has no legitimate source.",
    lesson:"Mexican regulations permit up to 1% undisclosed additives even in 100% agave tequila — glycerin for body, sweetener, oak extract, caramel color. None of it is illegal; all of it is invisible on the label. Your palate is the only detector you have." },
  { name:"Is Your Vermouth Dead?", cat:"Amaro & Vermouth", teaches:"The single most common flaw on any back bar.",
    pours:["A freshly opened bottle of sweet vermouth","The bottle currently on your back bar","The same fresh bottle after a week unrefrigerated, if you're patient"],
    look:"Nose both. Fresh vermouth smells like wine with herbs; oxidized vermouth smells like raisins, sherry, and dust.",
    lesson:"Vermouth is wine. An open bottle at room temperature is noticeably degraded within a week and undrinkable within a month. Refrigerate, date the bottle, buy smaller formats. This one habit improves more of your cocktails than any technique you can practice." },
  { name:"Where the Bitterness Lives", cat:"Amaro & Vermouth", teaches:"To place a bitter liqueur by its source, not its brand.",
    pours:["Campari — citrus-peel and root bitterness","Cynar — vegetal artichoke bitterness","Fernet-Branca — menthol, saffron, and aggressive root"],
    look:"Note when the bitterness arrives — immediately, mid-palate, or only at the finish — and how long it stays.",
    lesson:"Amari differ less in intensity than in the location and timing of their bitterness. Once you can identify that, substituting intelligently becomes possible: a Negroni made with Cynar isn't worse, it's a different drink with a known shape." },
  { name:"Proof, Water, and Texture", cat:"Whiskey", teaches:"That dilution is a tool, not a compromise.",
    pours:["Any cask-strength whiskey, poured three times","Glass one neat","Glass two with a few drops of water; glass three with roughly 20% water"],
    look:"Nose and taste each in order. Track when aromas open up and when they flatten out.",
    lesson:"Water breaks alcohol's surface tension and releases volatile aromatics — this is precisely what shaking and stirring do for a cocktail. Finding the point where a whiskey opens and the point where it collapses is the most direct lesson available in why dilution is an ingredient." },
  { name:"Pot Still Versus Column", cat:"Brandy", teaches:"How still design shapes a spirit before wood ever touches it.",
    pours:["A VSOP cognac (double pot distilled)","A Bas-Armagnac (single continuous column, lower proof)","A pisco (pot, distilled to proof, unaged)"],
    look:"Compare weight and aromatic intensity before judging the wood.",
    lesson:"Cognac's double pot distillation to a higher proof yields elegance and polish; armagnac's single low-proof column pass leaves more congeners and more rustic aroma. Pisco, distilled to final strength with no water added and no wood, shows what the still alone produces." },

const TASTE_METHOD = [
  ["Set up honestly","Use the same glass for every pour — a Glencairn or copita, never a rocks glass or balloon snifter. Pour equal, modest measures (half an ounce is plenty). Room temperature. Good light against a white background. If you're evaluating rather than enjoying, have a spit cup; a serious flight will otherwise end your usefulness for the evening."],
  ["Nose it properly","Keep your mouth slightly open and take short, gentle sniffs from just above the rim — jamming your nose into the glass anaesthetizes you with ethanol. Nose each pour before tasting any of them. Your first impression is the most honest one you'll get, so write it down before you start second-guessing."],
  ["Then taste","Take a small sip and let it coat your whole mouth before swallowing or spitting. The first sip mostly registers alcohol — it's the second that tells you anything. Note where flavors appear: front palate, mid, or only after you swallow. Finish length is a real quality signal; count the seconds it lingers."],
  ["Add water deliberately","A few drops opens most spirits above 45% ABV, releasing aromatics that alcohol was masking. Nose again after the water — it's often a different spirit. This is the clearest demonstration of why dilution belongs in a cocktail rather than being a necessary evil."],
  ["Manage palate fatigue","Taste light to heavy, unpeated before peated, low proof before high. Three to five pours is a real session; beyond six, you're guessing. Reset with plain water and unsalted crackers, not coffee. If everything starts tasting like alcohol, you're done — stop and come back tomorrow."],
  ["Write before you look","Always record your notes before you learn what you tasted. Knowing the label rewrites your perception instantly and permanently. Blind tasting isn't a party trick; it's the only way to know whether your palate or your expectations are doing the work."],
  ["Build the vocabulary","Use the same words consistently, even imprecise ones, so your notes are comparable over time. Aroma vocabulary is learned, not innate — smell your ingredients deliberately: crack a coriander seed, smell juniper berries, taste your syrups. Nearly all of what people call taste is smell, and smell is trainable."],
