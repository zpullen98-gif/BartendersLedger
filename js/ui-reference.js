Use the respectful name and gently translate when guests use the old one." },

  { name:"Redheaded Slut", cat:"Classic Shooters", spec:["3/4 oz Jägermeister","3/4 oz peach schnapps","3/4 oz cranberry juice"], method:"Shake, strain", note:"One of the most-called shots in America despite the name — many bars have quietly rebranded it 'Ginger Snap' or 'Redhead.'

  { name:"Black and Tan", cat:"Layered", spec:["1/2 pint pale ale or lager","1/2 pint stout, poured over a spoon"], method:"Fill halfway with the lighter beer, then pour the stout slowly over an inverted spoon", note:"Beer layering follows the same density rule.

  { name:"Dr Pepper Shot", cat:"Bombs & Boilermakers", spec:["3/4 oz amaretto","1/4 oz 151 rum (shot)","1/2 glass lager"], method:"Drop the shot into the beer, drink fast", note:"Tastes remarkably like the soda. No Dr Pepper involved at any point." },
  { name:"Bomb Pop", cat:"Bombs & Boilermakers", spec:["1/2 oz grenadine","1/2 oz blue curaçao","1/2 oz vodka","1/2 glass lemon-lime soda or energy drink"], method:"Layer bottom-up by density — grenadine, curaçao, vodka — then drop", note:"All three Bomb Pop colors in the glass — the bands stack red, blue, white by density, since vodka floats on everything (see the ladder). The layering is the whole appeal." },

  // INDUSTRY HANDSHAKES (+2)
  { name:"Salt & Lime Tequila", cat:"Industry Handshakes", spec:["1.5 oz blanco tequila","lime wedge","pinch of salt"], method:"Salt on the hand, lick, shoot, bite the lime", note:"The ritual most guests expect — and the one most Mexican bartenders would gently steer you away from. Salt and lime exist to mask a rough spirit; with good tequila, offer sangrita or a simple sip instead." },
  { name:"Shift Beer & Shot", cat:"Industry Handshakes", spec:["1.5 oz whiskey (or amaro)","1 cold cheap beer"], method:"Poured at the end of a shift, drunk sitting down", note:"Not a recipe so much as a ritual — the closing-time boilermaker every bar crew shares.

  { name:"Flaming Sambuca", cat:"Flaming & Novelty", spec:["1.5 oz sambuca","3 coffee beans"], method:"Ignite briefly to toast the beans, extinguish, let the glass cool before serving", note:"The flame toasts the beans and warms the anise oils. The glass gets genuinely hot — cool it and warn the guest." },
  { name:"Flaming Lamborghini", cat:"Flaming & Novelty", spec:["1 oz coffee liqueur","1 oz sambuca","1/2 oz blue curaçao","1/2 oz Irish cream"], method:"Layer the coffee liqueur and sambuca, ignite the sambuca for the show, extinguish completely, then pour in the curaçao and Irish cream and serve with a straw", note:"Pure 1980s theater. The traditional serve — pouring into the burning glass while the guest drinks — breaks both fire rules in this book: never pour near open flame, never hand a guest a lit glass. The show ends before the glass crosses the bar. Many bars have banned it outright — know your house rules and your insurance." },
  { name:"Cement Mixer", cat:"Flaming & Novelty", spec:["3/4 oz Irish cream","1/4 oz lime juice"], method:"Cream first, lime second — swish in the mouth before swallowing", note:"The acid curdles the cream on the tongue. A gag shot, not a drink — never serve it to someone who didn’t order it knowingly." },
  { name:"Blue Blazer Shot", cat:"Flaming & Novelty", spec:["1.5 oz cask-strength scotch","1.5 oz boiling water","1 tsp demerara sugar"], method:"Ignite and pour the flaming liquid between two metal mugs, then serve", note:"Jerry Thomas’s 1862 showpiece, scaled down. Practice with cold water dozens of times before you ever strike a match." },

const SHOT_SERVICE = [
  ["Building a round like a pro","For a round of six: multiply the spec by six plus a splash extra for foam and loss, shake it all in one large tin, line the glasses rim to rim in a tight row, and pour in one continuous back-and-forth motion — first pass fills halfway, second pass levels them. Even fill is the mark of the craft; topping up glass-by-glass reads amateur and wastes seconds you don’t have on a Saturday."],
  ["Layering physics","Layers hold because of sugar density, not alcohol: the sweetest, heaviest liqueur goes first, the lightest last. Pour each layer slowly over the back of an inverted barspoon touching the glass wall. Cold bottles layer cleaner than warm ones. Learn the B-52 order cold and every other layered shot follows the same logic — when in doubt, more sugar sinks."],
  ["Bombs, glassware & house policy","Dropped shot glasses chip pint glasses, and chipped glass near mouths is a lawsuit. Many bars serve bomb components side by side and let the guest do the drop — know your house policy before your first Saturday. Cream-plus-stout bombs curdle within a minute, so serve them last in a round and tell the table to go immediately."],
  ["Naming diplomacy","Shot recipes vary wildly bar to bar — if a guest calls a shot you don’t know, the professional move is a friendly 'how do you like that made?' They’ll happily tell you, and you’ll learn your neighborhood’s dialect. Some legacy shot names are crude or genuinely offensive; use the renamed versions (Irish Slammer, not the old name) and translate gently when guests use the originals. You set the tone of your bar."],
  ["Flaming shots & fire safety","If your bar allows them at all: never pour from a bottle anywhere near an open flame — the bottle can flash back. Extinguish every flame before the glass reaches a guest, never hand over a lit glass, keep a wet bar towel and a lid within arm’s reach, tie back hair and roll sleeves, and check that nothing above the bar is flammable. Flamed glass stays hot far longer than it looks; cool it before serving. Many venues and insurers ban flaming service outright — know your house rule before a guest asks."],
  ["Know your shot glass","A 'pony' is 1 oz, a standard shot is 1.5 oz, a double is 2 oz, and 'cheater' glasses have thick false bottoms that hold well under an ounce while looking full. Know exactly what your house glass holds — it determines your pour cost, your responsible-service count, and whether a guest feels cheated. When batching a round, measure to the glass you’re actually using, not the one in your head."],
  ["Responsible shot service","Shots are the fastest route to over-service: they bypass the natural pacing of a sipped drink. Count a round against each guest like a full drink (count the two-ounce Four Horsemen as a double; a Three Wise Men is one full drink), keep water on the bar, and slow the train early — 'let me get some waters going with these.' Never stack a second round in front of a visibly intoxicated guest, and remember the birthday crowd’s enthusiasm is not your legal defense. Your right to refuse is also your duty."],

  "Green Tea":"Nearly universal as Irish whiskey + peach schnapps + sour + a soda splash — but some houses use Jameson specifically and call anything else a White Tea, some skip the soda entirely, and Midwest bars often build it as a tall 'Green Tea Shot' over ice. Ask which they mean.",
  "Washington Apple":"Canadian whisky in the Northwest, but Crown Royal specifically in most of the Midwest and South. Some bars build it with apple schnapps and no cranberry; others serve it tall.",
  "Alabama Slammer":"The 1970s original is amaretto + sloe gin + Southern Comfort. Many modern bars drop the sloe gin (hard to stock) and add vodka. Both are 'correct' depending on the ZIP code.",
  "Oatmeal Cookie":"Butterscotch + Irish cream + cinnamon schnapps is the base. Some houses add a bar spoon of Jägermeister for a 'baked' note; others swap in Goldschläger for the cinnamon.",
  "Kool-Aid":"The name attaches to at least four different builds depending on the region — vodka/amaretto/melon/cranberry is the most common, but 'Cherry Kool-Aid' with cherry liqueur is its own thing entirely.",
  "Mind Eraser":"Layered in a rocks glass and drunk through a straw is the original. Some bars shake and serve it as a straight shooter, which loses the whole point — the straw pulls the layers in reverse.",
  "Red Snapper":"Whisky + amaretto + cranberry as a shot in the Midwest, but 'Red Snapper' also means a gin Bloody Mary in old-school New York hotel bars. Confirm before you build.",
  "Irish Slammer":"Formerly sold under a name referencing car bombings; the industry has widely moved to Irish Slammer or Dublin Drop. Some guests still use the old name innocently — take the order graciously and use the new name back.",
  "Three Wise Men":"Jack, Jim, and Johnnie is the classic trio. 'Three Wise Men Go Hunting' adds Wild Turkey; 'and a Mexican' adds tequila. Each addition is another half ounce of liquor — count accordingly.",
  "Jägerbomb":"Dropped is traditional, but a growing number of bars serve the components side by side to protect glassware. Some houses also pre-batch the Jäger portion in a chilled bottle for speed on busy nights.",
  "Prairie Fire":"Tequila and hot sauce is standard, but the heat level varies wildly. Always ask 'how hot do you want it?' and never serve one as a prank on an unsuspecting guest.",
  "Liquid Cocaine":"At least four unrelated builds carry this name — Jäger/peppermint/151 is the most common, but some bars mean Rumple Minze and Bacardi 151, others a blue vodka shooter. Always ask.",
  "Redheaded Slut":"Jäger, peach schnapps, and cranberry is near-universal, but many houses now list it as 'Ginger Snap' or simply 'Redhead.' Some bars shake it; others build it as a bomb with the cranberry as the chaser.",
  "Bazooka Joe":"Layered in most bars, shaken in busy ones. Some swap the blue curaçao for blue raspberry schnapps, which changes the color but not the bubble-gum trick.",
  "Pickleback":"Irish whiskey is the Bushwick original, but bourbon and even mezcal picklebacks are common now. The brine matters more than the whiskey — house-made dill brine is the flex.",

const NA_THEORY = [
  ["What alcohol actually does","Ethanol contributes five things: body and viscosity, warmth on the palate, length (that lingering finish), aromatic carry (it evaporates and pushes smell to your nose), and a solvent that dissolves bitter and herbal compounds. A zero-proof drink fails when it replaces none of these and just tastes like sweet juice. Build back each function deliberately."],
  ["Acid is your spine","Citrus, verjus, shrubs (drinking vinegars), and tart juices give the structure that makes a drink taste like a drink. Vinegar acidity lands differently from citrus — sharper, longer, more savory. Most weak NA drinks are underacidified, not undersweetened."],
  ["Bitterness is the adult signal","Nothing separates a cocktail from a soda faster than bitterness. Reach for tonic’s quinine, grapefruit, hibiscus, strong tea tannin, chicory, cascara, NA aperitivi, and non-alcoholic bitters. The bitter-and-complex family is the one guests are most surprised by."],
  ["Texture is a flavor","Aquafaba (chickpea liquid) foams like egg white at about 1 oz per drink. Cream, coconut milk, honey syrup, rich 2:1 syrups, and cloudy unfiltered juices all add the weight ethanol used to. A thin NA drink feels incomplete even when the flavors are right."],
  ["Salt, heat & aroma","Two to four drops of 20% saline suppresses harsh bitterness and lengthens the finish — the single highest-leverage trick in zero-proof work. Fresh ginger, chile, and black pepper create genuine palate warmth. Expressed citrus peels, slapped herbs, and torched rosemary put aroma where alcohol used to carry it."],
  ["Sweetness is the usual failure","The number one flaw in mocktails is too much sugar with nothing to fight it. Every gram of sweetness needs an opposing force: acid, bitterness, tannin, or salt. Taste with a straw and adjust the acid before you adjust the sugar."],
  ["Dilution still applies","Zero-proof drinks still need water — shake or stir them exactly as long as their alcoholic counterparts. Undiluted, they taste syrupy and cloying. Big cubes for slow-sipping builds, crushed ice for anything mint-driven."],
  ["The soda fountain was here first","American soda fountains spent a century perfecting non-alcoholic drinks — phosphates, egg creams, rickeys, Italian sodas — largely because Prohibition-era pharmacists had to. That tradition is a working recipe archive, not nostalgia: acid phosphate, flavored syrups, and hard-carbonated seltzer solve exactly the problems modern zero-proof bartenders keep rediscovering."],
  ["The NA spirits landscape","Modern non-alcoholic spirits fall into three useful groups: botanical distillates (gin-like, juniper and citrus forward), bitter aperitivi (Campari-style, the most successful category by far), and dark-spirit alternatives (whiskey and rum analogues, which are the hardest to pull off). Use them as ingredients, not as one-to-one swaps — most need extra acid, salt, or bitterness to sing. Trust your palate over the label’s claims."],
];

const NA_PANTRY = [
  ["Rich simple (2:1)","Two parts sugar to one part water by weight. More body and a longer shelf life than 1:1 — the default sweetener for zero-proof work, where texture is scarce."],
  ["Honey & maple syrup","Honey 3:1 with warm water; maple straight. Both bring viscosity and flavor that plain sugar can’t — invaluable when there’s no alcohol supplying weight."],
  ["Fruit shrub (drinking vinegar)","Equal parts by weight: chopped fruit, sugar, and vinegar (apple cider or champagne). Macerate fruit and sugar 24 hours, add vinegar, rest 3 days, strain. Keeps a month refrigerated. One ounce in soda is a complete drink."],
  ["Oleo saccharum","Peel 4 lemons or oranges, toss the peels with 1/2 cup sugar, rest 2–12 hours. The sugar draws out pure citrus oil into a fragrant syrup — the most aromatic sweetener you can make, and the secret to great punch."],
  ["20% saline solution","20 g fine salt dissolved in 80 g warm water. Dropper bottle on your station. Two to four drops per drink lengthens the finish and rounds bitterness. Use it in everything."],
  ["Verjus","The pressed juice of unripe grapes — wine’s acidity and subtle complexity with no fermentation. Sub it for part of the citrus in any spritz or spritz-adjacent build."],
  ["Tea concentrates","Steep at double strength and chill. Black tea for tannic grip, lapsang souchong for smoke, hibiscus for tartness and color, chamomile for honeyed florals. Your most versatile NA base ingredients, and nearly free."],
  ["Aquafaba","The liquid from a can of chickpeas. One ounce foams like an egg white, is shelf-stable, vegan, and carries no allergen risk from raw egg. Dry shake it exactly as you would egg."],
  ["Spiced & herb syrups","Simple syrup steeped with rosemary, sage, dill, lavender, ginger, cinnamon, or fennel. Steep off the heat 20 minutes, strain, refrigerate a month. The fastest way to build a deep NA menu from a small pantry."],
  ["House ginger beer","Juice fresh ginger, combine equal parts ginger juice and simple syrup with a squeeze of lime, refrigerate. Mix one part base to three parts soda to order. It transforms every mule, buck, and Dark 'n' Stormy on your menu, alcoholic or not."],
  ["Acid phosphate","The old soda-fountain acidulant — clean mineral tartness with no citrus flavor. A quarter teaspoon brightens any drink where lemon would add the wrong flavor. Sold by specialty suppliers and worth the shelf space."],
  ["Real grenadine","Equal parts pomegranate juice and sugar, gently warmed, with a splash of pomegranate molasses and a few drops of orange flower water. Nothing on the market compares, and half your NA classics depend on it."],
];

const NA_SERVICE = [
  ["Never ask why","A guest not drinking may be in recovery, pregnant, on medication, driving, observing their faith, or simply not in the mood — and none of it is your business. Take the order in exactly the voice you’d use for a Manhattan. The absence of a question is the hospitality."],
  ["Watch the hidden alcohol","This is the detail most bars miss. Standard aromatic bitters are around 44% ABV, vanilla extract about 35%, and 'non-alcoholic' beers and wines are legally allowed up to 0.5% ABV. Trace amounts are irrelevant to most guests and absolutely not to someone in recovery. Keep alcohol-free bitters on hand, know which of your syrups and extracts contain alcohol, and if a guest signals it matters, say plainly: 'I’ll build this with nothing alcoholic at all, including bitters.'"],
  ["Language and menu placement","List zero-proof drinks on the main menu with real names and real prices — not a sad italicized footnote. Many guests dislike the word 'mocktail'; 'zero proof,' 'spirit-free,' or simply listing them among the cocktails avoids the diminutive. Your menu tells people who belongs at your bar."],
  ["Price honestly","Fresh juice, house syrups, and five minutes of labor cost what they cost. Charging fairly (usually a few dollars under a cocktail) signals the drink is real work, not a courtesy. Charging nothing implies it’s worth nothing — and guests notice."],
  ["Same craft, same theater","Proper glassware, fresh garnish, a coupe if it belongs in a coupe, the same expressed peel and the same care. A zero-proof drink served in a plastic cup with a sad lime tells the guest exactly where they rank."],
  ["Include them in the round","When a table orders shots, offer the sober guest something in a shot glass too — a ginger-turmeric shot, chilled tart cherry with lime, a cold-brew shooter. Same glass, same timing, same clink. Nobody should have to explain an empty hand at a toast."],
  ["Batch for volume","Zero-proof drinks are usually the slowest thing on your station. Pre-batch the shelf-stable portions (tea bases, syrups, purées), keep juice fresh, and you can build one in twenty seconds instead of two minutes — which is what makes a real NA program survive a Saturday."],
  ["Know your NA back-bar","Stock at minimum: an NA bitter aperitivo, one botanical distillate, alcohol-free bitters, good tonic, an NA sparkling wine, quality tea, and one shrub. That short list plus fresh citrus and syrups covers nearly every drink in this section."],

const PRIMERS = {
  'Gin':[
    ["How gin is actually made","Gin starts as a finished neutral spirit — almost nobody distills their own base. What separates producers is what happens next. Steeping (maceration) soaks botanicals in the spirit before distillation, pulling heavier oils and deeper color. Vapor infusion suspends botanicals in a basket above the liquid so only the volatile aromatics carry over, giving a lighter, brighter gin. One-shot distillation means the still output is the final proof; multi-shot makes a concentrate that’s diluted with more neutral spirit afterward — vastly more efficient and used by most large brands, and not inherently worse."],
    ["What the legal categories mean","London Dry is a method, not a place: nothing but water may be added after distillation, no artificial flavoring, no sweetening beyond a trace. Plymouth Gin is a protected style from one distillery. Old Tom is lightly sweetened, the historical bridge between Dutch genever and modern dry gin. Genever is malt-wine based and closer to a light whiskey. Contemporary or New Western gins simply dial juniper back and let another botanical lead — legal as long as juniper still dominates."],
  ],
  'Bourbon & Rye':[
    ["The legal skeleton","Bourbon: at least 51% corn, distilled to no more than 160 proof, barreled at no more than 125 proof in new charred oak, made in the USA, nothing added. Rye: the same rules with at least 51% rye. 'Straight' means at least two years with no additives. 'Bottled in Bond' is stricter still — one distillery, one distilling season, at least four years in a federally supervised warehouse, exactly 100 proof. That last one is the most trustworthy label in American whiskey and usually the best value on the shelf."],
    ["What actually creates flavor","Mashbill matters less than people think; wood and warehouse matter more. Barrel entry proof is a quiet variable — lower entry proof (Wild Turkey at 115, Michter’s at 103) means less water added at bottling and a richer texture. Warehouse position changes everything: upper floors run hot and age fast, lower floors stay cool and slow. Yeast strain is the underrated one — Four Roses runs five proprietary strains that produce genuinely different whiskeys from identical grain."],
    ["The sourcing question","A great deal of American 'craft' whiskey is distilled at MGP in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, then bottled under other labels. That includes the 95% rye mashbill behind many well-known ryes. Sourcing isn’t dishonest — MGP makes excellent whiskey — but pretending otherwise is. Knowing which bottles share a source is basic bar literacy and stops you from paying triple for the same liquid."],
  ],
  'Scotch':[
    ["Malt, peat and smoke","Barley is malted — germinated then dried — and if that drying happens over a peat fire, the smoke phenols bind to the grain and survive into the glass. Peating level is measured in ppm of phenols in the malt: Ardbeg’s malt runs around 55ppm, Laphroaig around 40, Highland Park lower and aromatic rather than medicinal because Orkney’s peat is heather rather than woodland. Almost all distilleries now buy commercially malted barley; the handful still doing floor maltings (Springbank, Laphroaig, Highland Park, Bowmore, Balvenie) do so partly for character and partly for identity."],
    ["Stills, cut and cask","Still shape dictates reflux: tall stills with long necks give lighter, more delicate spirit because heavy compounds fall back; short squat stills give oily, heavy spirit. The Macallan’s famously small stills concentrate character. Ardbeg runs a purifier pipe on its spirit still that increases reflux, which is why the most heavily peated malt on Islay tastes cleaner than its ppm suggests. But roughly 60–70% of a scotch’s flavor comes from the cask — which is why sherry-seasoned European oak versus ex-bourbon American oak is a bigger decision than most distilling variables."],
    ["Single malt versus blend","Single malt means 100% malted barley from one distillery — not one barrel, and not necessarily better. Blended scotch combines malt and grain whisky from multiple distilleries and is what most of the world drinks. Blending is a genuine craft: a good blender is balancing dozens of components toward a consistent target, which is harder than releasing a single cask. Blended malt (no grain, multiple distilleries) is the category where independents like Compass Box do their most interesting work."],
  ],
  'Irish & Japanese':[
    ["Single pot still — Ireland’s own category","Irish single pot still whiskey uses a mash of both malted and unmalted barley, distilled in pot stills at a single distillery. The unmalted portion began as tax avoidance — the 1785 malt tax was levied on malted grain — and accidentally created a style: creamy, oily, with a distinctive spicy grip nothing else quite matches. Triple distillation is common but not universal, and it produces a lighter, softer spirit than scotch’s typical two passes."],
    ["Japan’s borrowed and rebuilt tradition","Masataka Taketsuru studied chemistry and distilling in Scotland in 1918, worked for Shinjiro Torii at Yamazaki, then founded Nikka in the north where the climate resembled Scotland. Japanese producers historically don’t trade casks with each other, so a single distillery must generate every component it needs for blending — hence Yamazaki running multiple still shapes and sizes under one roof. Mizunara oak, Japanese oak, is porous, difficult to coop, and imparts sandalwood and incense notes after long aging. Note that Japanese labeling rules only tightened in 2021, so older bottles labeled 'Japanese whisky' sometimes contained imported liquid."],
  ],
  'Rum':[
    ["The least regulated major spirit","Rum has no global standard. It can be made from molasses or fresh cane juice, in pot or column stills, aged anywhere, and in many jurisdictions sweetened or colored after aging without disclosure. Color tells you almost nothing — caramel coloring is widespread and cheap. This is why producer knowledge matters more in rum than in any other category: the label may not tell you what’s in the bottle, but the distillery’s practices will."],
    ["Style by tradition, not by color","The old shorthand still works. Spanish-heritage (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic): column-distilled, light, clean, filtered. English-heritage (Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana): pot still or pot-column blends, rich and often funky. French-heritage rhum agricole (Martinique, Guadeloupe, Haiti): distilled from fresh-pressed cane juice rather than molasses, grassy and vegetal, protected by AOC rules in Martinique since 1996."],
    ["Esters, dunder and funk","Jamaican 'funk' is ester chemistry. Long wild fermentations, plus dunder (the acidic residue left after distillation) and in extreme cases muck pits, generate fruity esters measured in grams per hectoliter of pure alcohol. Hampden Estate’s marks run from moderate to among the highest legally exportable. Tropical aging is the other great variable: heat and humidity mean rum in the Caribbean can lose 6–10% a year to evaporation versus around 2% in Scotland, so a tropically aged eight-year has done work comparable to a much older continental whisky."],
  ],
  'Agave':[
    ["From plant to bottle","Blue Weber agave takes six to eight years to mature. The piñas are harvested by jimadores, cooked to convert inulin into fermentable sugar, crushed, fermented, and distilled — usually twice in copper pots. Every step is a fork in the road. Brick ovens or autoclaves: slow masonry ovens over 24–36 hours build cooked-agave sweetness; industrial autoclaves do it in hours with less character. Diffusers, which strip sugar with hot water and acid without cooking at all, are efficient and widely considered to strip the agave’s soul with it."],
    ["Tahona, fibers and fermentation","The tahona is a two-ton volcanic stone wheel that crushes cooked agave; roller mills do the same job faster. Producers who ferment with the fibers still in the tank (Fortaleza, Siete Leguas) get a rounder, more vegetal spirit. Open-air fermentation with ambient yeast adds complexity and unpredictability. Highland (Los Altos) agave tends fruitier and sweeter; valley agave tends earthier and more peppery."],
    ["Read the NOM","Every bottle of tequila carries a NOM number identifying the distillery that made it — and dozens of brands share a single NOM. Learning to read it tells you who actually made the liquid regardless of what the label implies. Also worth knowing: 'additive-free' has become a meaningful distinction, since Mexican regulations permit up to 1% of undisclosed additives (glycerin, sweeteners, oak extract, caramel) even in 100% agave tequila. Mezcal is the broader category — dozens of agave species, traditionally pit-roasted over wood and stone, mostly Oaxacan, usually made by a named palenquero in small batches."],
  ],
  'Brandy':[
    ["Cognac’s rules","Cognac must come from the delimited region around the town of Cognac, be made largely from Ugni Blanc grapes, be double-distilled in copper pot stills, and age at least two years in French oak. The crus matter: Grande Champagne is the most chalky and age-worthy, Petite Champagne next, then Borderies (floral, quick-maturing), Fins Bois and beyond. Age statements are minimums for the youngest component — VS is at least two years, VSOP four, XO ten since 2018. The big houses are blending houses: they buy from hundreds of grower-distillers rather than farming everything themselves."],
    ["Armagnac, Calvados, Pisco","Armagnac is older than cognac, distilled once in a continuous alambic armagnacais at lower proof, which leaves more flavor and less polish — rustic in the best sense, and frequently sold as single vintages. Calvados is Norman apple (and pear) brandy; Pays d’Auge, the top appellation, requires double pot distillation. Pisco is unaged grape brandy; Peruvian rules are notably strict — distilled to final proof with no water added afterward and no aging in anything that imparts flavor."],
  ],
  'Vermouth & Aperitivo':[
    ["Vermouth is wine, and that changes everything","Vermouth is aromatized, fortified wine — wine base, botanicals including mandatory wormwood (Artemisia, hence the name from German Wermut), fortifying spirit, and usually sugar. Because it is wine, it oxidizes. An open bottle on a warm back bar is dead in a week. Refrigerate it, date it, and buy smaller bottles that turn over faster. This single habit improves more cocktails than any technique you can learn."],
    ["The styles","Sweet or rosso is Italian in origin, dark from caramel rather than the grapes. Dry is French in origin, pale and higher-acid. Blanc or bianco is sweet but pale. Vermouth di Torino is a protected designation requiring Italian wine and local production. Chambéry, from Dolin, holds France’s only vermouth PGI. Quinquinas (Lillet, Cocchi Americano, Kina) are aromatized wines built on quinine bark rather than wormwood — legally a different category, and the reason a true Vesper is hard to reproduce since Kina Lillet was reformulated in 1986."],
  ],
  'Amaro & Liqueur':[
    ["What an amaro is","Amaro simply means bitter in Italian. The template is neutral spirit or wine infused with bitter botanicals — gentian, cinchona, rhubarb root, wormwood, angelica, citrus peel — then sweetened and often rested in oak. There is no legal definition and no standard strength, which is why the category spans light aperitivi around 11% ABV to Fernet at 39%. Learn them by weight and role instead: light aperitivo before a meal, heavier digestivo after."],
    ["Why the classics are irreplaceable","Several bar essentials are genuinely singular. Chartreuse is made by Carthusian monks from a 1605 manuscript; only two monks know the full recipe, the green color is natural chlorophyll, and the order deliberately capped production in 2023 to preserve monastic life — the shortage is a values decision, not a marketing one. Luxardo maraschino comes from marasca cherries the company grows itself, macerated for years then distilled, and tastes nothing like the neon cherry syrup people expect. Bénédictine’s 27-botanical recipe dates to 1863 and its 'D.O.M.' stands for Deo Optimo Maximo."],

Estate-grown cane, limestone-filtered water, blends of pot and column distillate, fully tropically aged with the resulting heavy angel’s share.", bar:"The Signature and 12 are the reliable choices for rum sours and tiki bases." },
  { name:"Mount Gay", cat:"Rum", where:"St. Michael, Barbados", est:"deed 1703", why:"Holds the earliest surviving documentary evidence of commercial rum production anywhere.", process:"Blends double-retort pot still and column distillate, aged in charred ex-bourbon oak in a comparatively dry Barbadian climate. The Black Barrel expression is finished in heavily charred barrels; the Master Blender Collection has begun disclosing far more production detail.", bar:"Eclipse is a solid, affordable workhorse; Black Barrel stands up in an Old Fashioned." },
  { name:"Demerara Distillers", cat:"Rum", where:"Guyana", est:"consolidated 1670s onward", why:"Operates the last wooden stills on earth — irreplaceable industrial heritage.", process:"When Guyana’s many estates closed, their stills were consolidated at Diamond. The result: the Port Mourant double wooden pot still, the Versailles single wooden pot, and the Enmore wooden Coffey still, all still in production. Wood contributes character copper cannot, and these stills cannot be replicated — they are maintained rather than rebuilt.", bar:"El Dorado and independent Demerara bottlings supply the rich, smoky backbone of a proper Zombie or Queen’s Park Swizzle." },
  { name:"Rhum J.M / Neisson", cat:"Rum", where:"Martinique", est:"1845 / 1932", why:"The purest expression of agricole, protected by the strictest rum rules in the world.", process:"AOC Martinique, granted in 1996, governs cane varieties, harvest timing, fermentation length, still design (single-column creole), distillation proof, and aging. Fresh-pressed cane juice must be distilled within hours of pressing, giving a grassy, olive-brine, vegetal spirit utterly unlike molasses rum. Neisson is family-run and among the smallest producers.", bar:"Essential for a Ti' Punch, and a revelation in a Daiquiri once you adjust the sugar." },
  { name:"Havana Club", cat:"Rum", where:"Cuba", est:"1878", why:"Defines the light Cuban style that the Daiquiri and Mojito were built on.", process:"Fermented and column-distilled to a light aguardiente, aged, filtered through charcoal to strip color, then often aged again. The maestros roneros system trains blenders over decades in a formal apprenticeship. Note the trademark dispute: the Cuban product and the Puerto Rican-made version sold in the US are different rums entirely.", bar:"The 3 Año is the Daiquiri benchmark where it’s available." },

  // AGAVE
  { name:"Fortaleza", cat:"Agave", where:"Tequila, Jalisco (NOM 1493)", est:"family since 1873", why:"The most complete surviving example of pre-industrial tequila production.", process:"Guillermo Erickson Sauza, great-great-grandson of Don Cenobio Sauza, rebuilt his family’s methods on the original estate. Agave cooked slowly in brick ovens, crushed by a two-ton volcanic stone tahona wheel, fermented in open wooden tanks with the agave fibers left in, and distilled in small copper pots. Every one of those choices costs yield and adds character.", bar:"Too good to bury in a Margarita — but a Fortaleza Old Fashioned is a revelation." },
  { name:"Tequila Ocho", cat:"Agave", where:"Arandas, Jalisco (NOM 1474)", est:"2008", why:"Proved agave has terroir by putting it on the label.", process:"A collaboration between the Camarena family and the late Tomas Estes. Each bottling is single-estate and vintage-dated by the specific field it came from, so you can taste two expressions made identically from different plots and different years. Brick ovens, roller mill, open fermentation, copper pots.", bar:"Buy two vintages and taste them side by side — it’s the single best agave education available." },
  { name:"Siete Leguas", cat:"Agave", where:"Atotonilco, Jalisco (NOM 1120)", est:"1952", why:"The quiet benchmark, and the original source of a far more famous brand.", process:"Produced Patrón from 1989 until 2002, when Patrón moved production elsewhere. Runs two production lines in parallel — one using a tahona, one a roller mill — and blends them. Ferments with the fibers included, distills in copper pots, and has changed remarkably little in seventy years.", bar:"A tequila that rewards a well-made cocktail without demanding you skip the mixers." },
  { name:"G4 / El Pandillo", cat:"Agave", where:"Jesús María, Jalisco (NOM 1579)", est:"2010s", why:"Traditional character achieved through genuinely inventive engineering.", process:"Felipe Camarena built much of the distillery himself, including a shredder nicknamed the Tahona Frankenstein. Uses a mix of rainwater and deep-well spring water in production — a real variable, since water source measurably affects fermentation. Brick ovens, open-air fermentation, no additives.", bar:"Widely stocked by agave-serious bars precisely because it tastes like the old style at a working price." },
  { name:"Cascahuín", cat:"Agave", where:"El Arenal, Jalisco (NOM 1123)", est:"1904", why:"Valley-style tequila made the old way by a family that never modernized much.", process:"Salvador Rosales Briseño’s third-generation operation. Brick ovens, some tahona production, open fermentation, and bottlings at higher proof including a 48% blanco that agave enthusiasts prize. Valley agave gives the earthy, peppery, mineral profile that contrasts with the fruitier highlands style.", bar:"The higher-proof blanco is exceptional in a Margarita or a Batanga." },
  { name:"Del Maguey", cat:"Agave", where:"Oaxaca and beyond", est:"1995", why:"Changed how the world buys mezcal by naming the village and the maker.", process:"Ron Cooper’s single-village model put the palenquero’s name, the pueblo, the agave species, and the elevation on the label at a time when mezcal was sold as an anonymous commodity with a worm in it. Traditional production: agave roasted in earthen pits over wood and volcanic rock, crushed by horse-drawn tahona, fermented in open wood with wild yeast, distilled in small copper or clay pots.", bar:"Vida is built for cocktails; the single-village bottlings are for sipping and teaching." },
  { name:"Mezcal Vago / Rey Campero", cat:"Agave", where:"Oaxaca", est:"2010s", why:"The current standard-bearers for maker-forward, small-batch mezcal.", process:"Both operate on the model of naming the individual mezcalero and documenting the batch: agave species (espadín, tobalá, madrecuixe, tepeztate), village, still type, and often the exact batch proof. Wild agave species can take fifteen to thirty years to mature, which is why they cost what they do and why sustainability is a live issue in the category.", bar:"Pour these for anyone who thinks mezcal just means 'smoky.'" },

  // BRANDY
  { name:"Hennessy", cat:"Brandy", where:"Cognac, France", est:"1765", why:"The largest cognac house on earth, and the reference against which the category is measured.", process:"A blending house rather than a farm: buys eaux-de-vie from hundreds of grower-distillers across the crus, then blends and ages. The tasting committee has met daily for generations to assess new spirit. Their own cooperage sources and air-dries Limousin oak for years before coopering.", bar:"VS or VSOP is the honest working cognac for a Sidecar or a Vieux Carré." },
  { name:"Pierre Ferrand", cat:"Brandy", where:"Grande Champagne, Cognac", est:"1989", why:"The house that made cognac make sense to bartenders again.", process:"Alexandre Gabriel works exclusively in Grande Champagne, the chalkiest and most age-worthy cru, and successfully petitioned to revive historical production practices including different cask sizes and distillation methods. Their 1840 Original Formula was reverse-engineered from a period recipe specifically to match how cognac tasted when the classic cocktails were written.", bar:"1840 is arguably the correct cognac for 19th-century recipes. Their Dry Curaçao is a bar essential in its own right." },
  { name:"Delamain", cat:"Brandy", where:"Grande Champagne, Cognac", est:"1824", why:"A house that makes only old, dry, single-cru cognac and nothing else.", process:"Buys only aged Grande Champagne eaux-de-vie, blends them, and bottles at the minimum reduction — no sugar, no boisé, no caramel, which many houses permit within the rules. Every release is well beyond XO minimums.", bar:"A neat pour and a conversation, not a mixer." },
  { name:"Château du Tariquet", cat:"Brandy", where:"Bas-Armagnac", est:"1912", why:"Makes the case that armagnac’s rusticity is a feature.", process:"Single-estate, distilled once in a continuous alambic armagnacais at low proof — roughly 52–60% — where cognac is double-distilled to a higher, cleaner strength. Less rectification leaves more congeners and more flavor. Frequently released as single vintages rather than blends, so you can drink a specific year.", bar:"Substitute for cognac in a Sidecar and the drink gets bigger and earthier." },
  { name:"Christian Drouin", cat:"Brandy", where:"Pays d’Auge, Normandy", est:"1960", why:"The benchmark for calvados, and an argument for apple brandy in the bar.", process:"Pays d’Auge is the top calvados appellation and requires double distillation in pot stills, plus cider made from a blend of specified apple varieties — bitter, bittersweet, sweet, and acidic — fermented slowly for weeks. Aged in a wide range of casks including former sherry, port, and calvados wood.", bar:"Essential for a proper Widow’s Kiss or Corpse Reviver #1." },
  { name:"Caravedo / Pisco Porton", cat:"Brandy", where:"Ica, Peru", est:"1684 hacienda", why:"Peru’s pisco rules are the strictest unaged-brandy regulations anywhere, and this estate embodies them.", process:"Peruvian pisco must be distilled to its final proof — no water may be added afterward, which means the distiller has to hit the target strength precisely at the still. It cannot be aged in anything that imparts flavor, so it rests in glass or stainless. Only eight approved grape varieties. The old hacienda’s stone fermentation vats remain in use.", bar:"A proper Pisco Sour needs a proper pisco — the difference is not subtle." },

  // VERMOUTH & APERITIVO
  { name:"Carpano", cat:"Vermouth & Aperitivo", where:"Turin, Italy", est:"1786", why:"Invented the category. Everything else in this section is downstream.", process:"Antonio Benedetto Carpano created the first commercial vermouth in Turin in 1786. Antica Formula is a recreation of that style — heavy vanilla, dried fruit, and bitter root, far richer than modern sweet vermouths. Punt e Mes, launched in 1870, adds a deliberate hit of extra bitterness, its name meaning 'point and a half' from a stockbroker’s order.", bar:"Antica makes a decadent Manhattan; Punt e Mes is the correct call for a Red Hook." },
  { name:"Cocchi", cat:"Vermouth & Aperitivo", where:"Asti, Piedmont", est:"1891", why:"Makes the closest available thing to a discontinued ingredient the classics depend on.", process:"Storico Vermouth di Torino follows the protected designation using Piedmontese wine. Cocchi Americano is a quinquina — built on quinine bark and gentian rather than wormwood — and is the standard modern substitute for the pre-1986 Kina Lillet a true Vesper calls for.", bar:"Keep Americano on the shelf specifically for Vespers and Corpse Revivers." },
  { name:"Dolin", cat:"Vermouth & Aperitivo", where:"Chambéry, Savoie", est:"1821", why:"Holds France’s only vermouth geographical protection, and defines the light alpine style.", process:"Chambéry PGI vermouth, made with alpine botanicals and a notably light hand — lower sugar, lower alcohol, more delicate than Italian styles. The Blanc in particular is a distinct third category between sweet and dry.", bar:"The default dry vermouth for a Martini where you want the gin to lead." },
  { name:"Noilly Prat", cat:"Vermouth & Aperitivo", where:"Marseillan, Languedoc", est:"1813", why:"Ages its wine outdoors on purpose — a process no one else replicates at scale.", process:"Base wines spend a year in oak casks in the enclos, an open-air yard where they are exposed to Mediterranean sun, sea air, and seasonal temperature swings. This deliberate, controlled oxidation produces the nutty, saline character that defines the Original Dry. The wine is then blended with botanical infusions and rested further.", bar:"Its salinity is why classic French recipes specify it by name." },
  { name:"Campari", cat:"Vermouth & Aperitivo", where:"Milan", est:"1860", why:"An entire family of cocktails exists because of one secret recipe.", process:"Created by Gaspare Campari; the botanical recipe remains undisclosed and is reportedly known to very few people. Its famous red once came from carmine derived from cochineal insects — the company switched to artificial coloring in 2006, which is a genuinely useful fact when a vegan guest asks.", bar:"Non-negotiable for Negronis, Boulevardiers, Americanos, and Jungle Birds." },
  { name:"Lillet", cat:"Vermouth & Aperitivo", where:"Podensac, Bordeaux", est:"1872", why:"Its reformulation is the reason one famous cocktail can’t be made as written.", process:"A Bordeaux-based aperitif wine blended with citrus liqueurs and aged in oak. The original Kina Lillet carried significant quinine bitterness; the 1986 reformulation to Lillet Blanc reduced it substantially for modern palates. Fleming’s Vesper was written for the older, more bitter product.", bar:"Fine in a Corpse Reviver #2; for a period-accurate Vesper, reach for Cocchi Americano." },

  // AMARO & LIQUEUR
  { name:"Chartreuse", cat:"Amaro & Liqueur", where:"Voiron, France", est:"recipe 1605", why:"Genuinely irreplaceable, and the only major spirit whose scarcity is a spiritual decision.", process:"Made by Carthusian monks from a 1605 manuscript, produced since 1737. Roughly 130 botanicals; only two monks know the complete recipe at any time. The green color is natural chlorophyll from the plants themselves, not added. Aged in oak vats. In 2023 the order announced it would cap production permanently to protect the monastic life of solitude and prayer — a values decision that created a global shortage.", bar:"Green (55%) for the Last Word and Chartreuse Swizzle; Yellow (40%, honeyed and gentler) for the Alaska and Greenpoint." },
  { name:"Fernet-Branca", cat:"Amaro & Liqueur", where:"Milan", est:"1845", why:"The bartender’s handshake, and the most aggressive amaro in wide circulation.", process:"Bernardino Branca’s recipe uses 27 herbs from four continents including saffron, myrrh, gentian, rhubarb, and chamomile, macerated then aged in oak for a year. Saffron is reportedly the single most expensive ingredient. The recipe has stayed in the family since founding, and the company famously bought enormous quantities of herbs during Prohibition when it was imported into the US as a medicinal product.", bar:"Two dashes in a Hanky Panky; an ounce in a Ferrari; a shot with the crew at close." },
  { name:"Luxardo", cat:"Amaro & Liqueur", where:"Torreglia, Veneto", est:"1821", why:"The maraschino standard — and nothing else tastes remotely like it.", process:"The company grows its own marasca cherries. Fruit, stems, leaves, and pits are macerated for years before distillation, which is where the almond-like bitterness comes from. The result is dry and funky rather than sweet, despite being a liqueur. The family fled Zara in 1947 and rebuilt in Italy from a single surviving cherry sapling.", bar:"Required for the Last Word, Aviation, Martinez, and Hemingway Daiquiri. Their cocktail cherries are the other bar essential." },
  { name:"Bénédictine", cat:"Amaro & Liqueur", where:"Fécamp, Normandy", est:"1863", why:"A honeyed herbal backbone that shows up in a surprising number of classics.", process:"Alexandre Le Grand marketed it as a rediscovered monastic recipe; historians consider the monastic origin story largely invented, but the liqueur itself is real and excellent. 27 botanicals including saffron, angelica, hyssop, and honey, distilled in four separate batches then blended and aged. D.O.M. on the label stands for Deo Optimo Maximo.", bar:"The Vieux Carré, Bobby Burns, Monte Carlo, and Singapore Sling all need it." },
  { name:"Cointreau", cat:"Amaro & Liqueur", where:"Angers, France", est:"1885", why:"The orange liqueur most classic recipes assume you’re using.", process:"A blend of sweet and bitter orange peels from multiple origins, macerated and double-distilled in copper pots, then blended and sweetened. Crucially it is clear and relatively dry at 40% ABV, so it contributes structure and strength rather than just sugar — which is why it behaves differently from a cheap triple sec in a Margarita or Sidecar.", bar:"The default for Margaritas, Sidecars, Corpse Revivers, and White Ladies." },
  { name:"Combier", cat:"Amaro & Liqueur", where:"Saumur, Loire", est:"1834", why:"Claims the original triple sec, and makes a genuinely distinct alternative.", process:"Jean-Baptiste Combier’s distillery still operates in its original building with stills reportedly designed by Gustave Eiffel’s workshop. Uses bitter oranges from Haiti and Turkey, distilled in copper pots. Drier and more orange-peel-driven than most competitors.", bar:"A worthwhile swap in a Sidecar when you want less sweetness." },
  { name:"Giffard", cat:"Amaro & Liqueur", where:"Angers, France", est:"1885", why:"Quietly restored several ingredients the classic canon needed to function.", process:"A family pharmacy turned liqueur house. Their crème de violette, crème de pêche, and Banane du Brésil are made with real fruit and flower infusions rather than flavoring, at a time when many of these categories had degraded into candy syrups. The Aviation was effectively unmakeable in the US for decades until violette returned to the market.", bar:"Violette for the Aviation and Blue Moon; their pineapple and banana liqueurs for tiki work." },
  { name:"Amaro Nonino", cat:"Amaro & Liqueur", where:"Friuli, Italy", est:"1933 / amaro 1992", why:"Built on grappa, and singlehandedly responsible for one modern classic.", process:"The Nonino family pioneered single-varietal, single-estate grappa distilled from fresh pomace, then built their Quintessentia amaro on that grappa base rather than neutral spirit. Botanicals infused, then aged in ex-sherry and ex-cognac barriques. Lighter and more orange-and-caramel than most amari.", bar:"The Paper Plane exists because of it, and no substitute quite works." },
  { name:"Cynar", cat:"Amaro & Liqueur", where:"Padua, Italy", est:"1952", why:"The artichoke amaro — strange on paper, indispensable in practice.", process:"Thirteen herbs and plants including artichoke leaf, which contributes a distinctive vegetal bitterness rather than the sweet-root profile of most amari. Available at 16.5% and, in the Cynar 70, at 70 proof for cocktail work.", bar:"Little Italy, Bitter Giuseppe, and the Art of Choke all depend on it. Also excellent simply with soda and an orange slice." },
