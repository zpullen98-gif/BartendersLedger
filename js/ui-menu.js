/* ---------------- MENU: the bar you actually work behind ----------------

   The Ledger teaches 365 cocktails in the abstract. A working bartender does
   not need 365 drinks on a Tuesday. They need the eighteen on their own menu,
   cold, and they need to know what they can still put up when the amaro runs
   out at ten past eleven. This tab is those two questions and nothing else.

   It replaces two things that were built years apart and never connected: the
   My Bar tab, which held the venue’s list but could not match it against
   anything, and the My Shelf panel in Tools, which held the whole stock engine
   but was framed as home bartending, down to a preset called 'Starter home
   bar'. The framing is gone. The engine moved here, where the menu is.

   THE KEY DID NOT MOVE. Records still carry src:'My Bar', so the card key is
   still "My Bar · <name>", which is what keeps a house Margarita from
   colliding with the canon one in the SRS, the rail and the mastery board, and
   what lets a backup taken years ago restore into this tab. srcLabel() in
   ui-study.js is the join between the key and the word on screen, and the long
   note above DECK_SOURCES says which sites take which.

   Three sub-views, not seven. 190-odd stock chips above or below a drink list
   makes both unreadable, and seven tabs wrap on a phone: a wrapped tab row
   stops reading as a place you can be. Two nouns and one verb. */
