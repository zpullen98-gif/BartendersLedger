/* ---------------- A MENU, AS TEXT, TURNED INTO ROWS ----------------

   Ported from the World Table's src/lib/menu-parse.ts, which is the same
   problem for food. Kept as close to its source as a classic script allows,
   so the two can still be diffed against each other, and every line of its
   comment is kept: the comments ARE the specification, and without them the
   next person has to re-derive why a title-case line needs a blank above it
   and a priced line below.

   Proved by tools/check-import.mjs, which is that file's own suite ported to
   node:test and run against THIS file rather than against a copy of it.

   Wrapped, because the parser has forty private helpers with names like
   scan, emit, words and NOISE, and this is a scope shared by fifteen files.
   parseMenuText is the only thing that comes out. */

	/**
	 * A venue's own menu, as text, turned into rows a bartender can correct.
	 *
	 * The venue types The Bar's Menu in by hand today, one drink at a time. This
	 * reads a photographed or pasted menu instead and produces a DRAFT: every row is
	 * meant to be looked at and fixed before it is saved. That is why every row
	 * carries `raw`, the source line it came from, and why `confidence` exists.
	 * Nothing here writes to the session; the screen does that, after a person has
	 * agreed to it.
	 *
	 * THE RULE IT WAS WRITTEN FOR, AND THE RULE IT SERVES HERE. In the World
	 * Table this parser never produces allergen information, because a photograph
	 * of a menu cannot tell anybody what is in a dish and there is no allergen
	 * field on a parsed row at all, which is the cheapest way to make that
	 * mistake impossible rather than merely discouraged.
	 *
	 * The Ledger has no allergens. Its version of the same rule is QUANTITIES,
	 * and it is exactly as sharp. A menu prints 'Gin, elderflower, cucumber'
	 * and says nothing whatever about how much of each. An ounce invented here
	 * would reach lineOz, and from there balanceOf, estimateABV, the batch sheet
	 * and the pour-cost sheet, and a bartender would be shown a printed
	 * percentage with a dollar sign in front of it that came from nowhere. So
	 * this parser produces `price` as PRINTED and never a measure, the cocktail
	 * layer in js/menu-drinks.js never puts one on a spec line, and
	 * tools/check-import.mjs asserts that no produced line matches lineOz's own
	 * pattern. Blank is a true answer. A guess is not.
	 *
	 * `tags` carries the dietary MARKS THE MENU ITSELF PRINTED, the (v) and the
	 * [GF] the bar chose to put on the page, and nothing is ever derived for it.
	 * A bar record has no field for them, so the drinks layer drops them; they
	 * are kept here because this file is shared with the World Table and losing
	 * them would make the two stop diffing.
	 *
	 * ON CASE, AND WHY SECTION NAMES COME BACK AS PRINTED. A heading typed
	 * "STARTERS" is returned as "STARTERS", not tidied to "Starters". Title-casing
	 * is a lie waiting to happen the moment a menu says BBQ, PX, DOP or IPA, and the
	 * bartender is already editing these rows, so retyping one heading costs less than a
	 * wrong one shipped silently on every drink under it.
	 *
	 * ON OCR DAMAGE. The dirty-input rules here are about WHITESPACE and stray
	 * characters, never about spelling or digits. An OCR pass that reads 9.5 as
	 * "9.S" leaves a row with no price and `confidence: 'low'`, and that is the
	 * correct outcome: repairing it to 9.5 would be the parser inventing a price,
	 * which is the one thing a menu importer must never do.

	 * input is a paste box, which means one day it will contain a novel, a whole PDF

	 * Total by construction: any string in, a result out, no throw. A line it cannot
	 * place becomes a low-confidence row rather than disappearing, because a junk row
	 * on screen is one click to delete and a dropped drink is invisible.
	 *
	 * THE ONE JUDGEMENT CALL WORTH KNOWING ABOUT is what happens to a priceless line
	 * in title case. 'Sides' and 'Bread' are the same shape and a menu prints both.
	 * Treating every one of them as a heading loses the side silently; treating none
	 * of them as a heading leaves 'To Begin' sitting in the drink column. So a
	 * title-case line becomes a heading only when it has a blank line above it and a
	 * priced line below, which is how menus lay headings out and is not how a side in
	 * the middle of a list looks. Shouted, decorated and colon-terminated headings
	 * need none of that, being unmistakable on their own. When the test fails the
	 * line becomes a low-confidence row, which is the recoverable direction.
